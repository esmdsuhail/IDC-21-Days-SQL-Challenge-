## Investigation Steps / Questions
# This challenge is designed to **make you think like a detective** — but using SQL instead of fingerprints.

#1. Identify where and when the crime happened

SELECT 
    room AS crime_spot
FROM
    keycard_logs
WHERE
    entry_time = '2025-10-15 21:00:00'
        OR exit_time = '2025-10-15 21:00:00';

#2. Analyze who accessed critical areas at the time

SELECT 
	k.log_id,
    k.employee_id,
    e.name AS employee_name,
    k.room,
    k.entry_time,
    k.exit_time
FROM keycard_logs k
JOIN employees e
ON k.employee_id = e.employee_id
WHERE entry_time = '2025-10-15 21:00:00'
        OR exit_time = '2025-10-15 21:00:00';

#3. Cross-check alibis with actual logs

SELECT 
	e.employee_id,
	e.name,
    k.room as actual_location,
    a.claimed_location,
    TIME(k.entry_time) AS entry_time,
    TIME(k.exit_time) AS exit_time,
    TIME(a.claim_time) AS claim_time
FROM alibis a
JOIN employees e 
ON a.employee_id = e.employee_id
JOIN keycard_logs k
ON a.employee_id = k.employee_id;

#4. Investigate suspicious calls made around the time

SELECT 
    e1.name AS caller_name,
    e2.name AS receiver_name,
    c.call_time,
    c.duration_sec
FROM calls c
JOIN employees e1 ON c.caller_id = e1.employee_id
JOIN employees e2 ON c.receiver_id = e2.employee_id
WHERE
    c.call_time BETWEEN '2025-10-15 20:00:00' AND '2025-10-15 21:00:00';

#5. Match evidence with movements and claims

SELECT
    e.name,
    k.room AS actual_location,
    a.claimed_location,
    ev.room AS evidence_room,
    ev.description AS evidence_description,
    k.entry_time,
    k.exit_time,
    a.claim_time
FROM employees e
JOIN keycard_logs k ON e.employee_id = k.employee_id
JOIN alibis a ON e.employee_id = a.employee_id
JOIN evidence ev ON k.room = ev.room
WHERE k.room = 'CEO Office';

#6. Combine all findings to identify the killer
SELECT
    e.name AS employee_name,
    kl.room AS actual_location,
    a.claimed_location,
    ev.description AS evidence_description,
    kl.entry_time,
    kl.exit_time,
    a.claim_time
FROM employees e
JOIN keycard_logs kl 
    ON e.employee_id = kl.employee_id
JOIN alibis a 
    ON e.employee_id = a.employee_id
JOIN evidence ev 
    ON kl.room = ev.room
WHERE
    kl.room = 'CEO Office'
    AND kl.entry_time <= '2025-10-15 21:00:00'AND kl.exit_time >= '2025-10-15 21:00:00';
	
#THE KILLER.

SELECT 
    DISTINCT(e.name) AS Killer
FROM employees e
JOIN keycard_logs k 
    ON e.employee_id = k.employee_id
JOIN alibis a 
    ON e.employee_id = a.employee_id
WHERE
    k.room = 'CEO Office'
    AND k.entry_time <= '2025-10-15 21:00:00'
    AND k.exit_time >= '2025-10-15 21:00:00';
