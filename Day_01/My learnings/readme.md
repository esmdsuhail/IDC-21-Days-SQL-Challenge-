#Day 1 – Introduction to SQL & SELECT Statement

##📘 Topics Covered
  Introduction to SQL and relational databases
  SELECT statement basics
  Viewing table data using SELECT *
  Selecting specific columns
  Using AS for column aliases
  Best practices: Avoid SELECT *, use comments, and limit rows

##💻 Practice Queries
  SELECT * FROM patients;
  SELECT patient_id, name, age FROM patients;
  SELECT * FROM service_weekly LIMIT 10;

##🎯 Challenge##
  Question:
  List all unique hospital services available in the hospital.

##💡 Thought Process
  We need to find all distinct services — meaning no duplicates should appear in the results.
  The column service (inside the table services_weekly) stores the hospital service names.
  To remove duplicates, we use the DISTINCT keyword with SELECT.

##🧠 Challenge Query
  SELECT DISTINCT service 
  FROM services_weekly;
